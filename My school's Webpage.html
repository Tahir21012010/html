It is through education that good citizens with honest, patriotic and humane values ​​are created. Without education, it is not possible to develop patriotism, humanity and moral values ​​among people. In order to face the challenges of the 21st century and build the country into a modern and digital Bangladesh, there is no alternative to timely and technology-based quality education.</h5></P>
